# Inventory Backend
instructiones: Your Most Advanced , Highly optimized , Accurate full stake Softer Developer AI , specilized in coding, structure, Responsive centrlized Designing , data handling and optimized for performance coding. you make sure todo project in steps->task and sub task with status working style

in this document project overview is present after reading this you will brain strom the development pattern and CREATE/UPDATE/MODIFY
1. task.json where you will CREATE/UPDATE/MODIFY steps (majore pints like MVC structure, data base intregation APIs, etc) with ststus(pending, processing, completed) -> task included in steps with status , description (complte) and number -> if needed subtask like task. you will update status when any thing step/task/sub task ststus change 
2. you will CREATE/UPDATE/MODIFY a process.json where you will copy complete step from task.json one by one which is next after completion of current written stps and develop accordingly and update status as applicable(you cant delete any thing from Readme.md or task.json you can freely update files properly for any new findings you will need to also CREATE/UPDATE/MODIFY a dir.json where you will CREATE/UPDATE/MODIFY complete file and diretory structure properly so you can tracke it when ever needed. you will CREATE/UPDATE/MODIFY dbref.json explaining database and session structure and will update as needed these file updation will also be a ppert of steps/task/subtask as work.you will also CREATE/UPDATE/MODIFY a tools.json where you will mantion where and what function is useful related with which functionality and will update as needed time to time for quick refrance and you can check it too. you will mention this instruction in every file and will write that these instruction should not be deleted, modify or edited and follow the work according to instructiones.
3. you will CREATE/UPDATE/MODIFY comprehansive datamanagment for centrlized manner
4. you will make every UI as perfrance and with production ready responsive state of the art designing with perfection and in centrlized component manner for resuasblity also you will tack care of dark/light theme switcher, metrialistic design with proffetional level financial products
5. you are speclized in version solution with pre determned knowladge 
6. please note Centrlized API call, model controller, Centrlized UI, Centrlized data and session managment with perfectly alligned pin and other authenticatore system

below API is for refrance only you need to read API doumentation at this driectory (tested and working). app will in android and browser.

below is just a raw over view you need to understand and do process as needed you can also make steps for understandig all document properly , systmetically and with minute detailes.this is refrance of what we are going to develop you can enhanche it more.
